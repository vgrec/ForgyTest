A Github template that lets you create an enterprise grade **Android / Compose Only / Single Activity / Multi Module** application project.

## How to use üë£

Just click on [![Use this template](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Use%20this%20template-brightgreen)](https://github.com/leinardi/Forlago/generate)
button to create a new repo starting from this template.

After successfully forking the template you have to:

- Replace all the occurrences of `com.leinardi.forlago` with the Application ID of your new project
- Replace all the occurrences of `forlago`/`Forlago`/`FORLAGO` with the name of your new project (remember to preserve the case!)
- Rename all the files containing `forlago`/`Forlago`/`FORLAGO` (e.g `ForlagoNavigator.kt` -> `YourProjectNameNavigator.kt`)
- Generate a new debug and release keystores `release/app-debug.jks` (see Release section below)
- Replace the App icons (you can generate new icons using [icon.kitchen](https://icon.kitchen/) by @romannurik)

## Features üé®

- 100% Kotlin-only Android code
- Compose only - Single Activity application
- Multi Module project structure
- CI Setup with GitHub Actions
- Dependency versions managed via `libs.versions.toml`

## Gradle Setup üêò

## CI ‚öôÔ∏è

This template is using [**GitHub Actions**](https://github.com/leinardi/Forlago/actions) as CI. You don't need to setup any external service and you
should have a running CI once you start using this template.

There are currently the following workflows available:

- [CI](.github/workflows/ci.yml) - Will be triggered on every new PR or every new commit pushed to the `master` branch.

## Release

### Generating new keystores

#### Generating debug keystore

```
keytool -genkeypair -dname "cn=First Last Name, ou=Mobile, o=My Company, c=US" -alias androiddebugkey -keypass android -keystore release/app-debug.jks -storepass android -keyalg RSA -sigalg SHA256withRSA -keysize 2048 -validity 9999
```

#### Generating release keystore

```
keytool -genkeypair -dname "cn=First Last Name, ou=Mobile, o=My Company, c=US" -alias release -keypass <STRONG PASSWORD GOES HERE> -keystore release/app-release.jks -storepass <STRONG PASSWORD GOES HERE> -keyalg RSA -sigalg SHA256withRSA -keysize 2048 -validity 9999
```

Add the release keystore and the encrypt secret passwords to
the [GitHub Actions secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) as `RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PWD` and `ENCRYPT_KEY`.

### Publishing on the Play Store

#### Prerequisites

To publish your app on the Play Store you need to create a service account with access to the Play Developer API and generate a new `play-account.gpg`
file. You can find instructions on how to generate a new service account [here](https://github.com/Triple-T/gradle-play-publisher#service-account).
Once you have the JSON key, place it in `release/play-account.json`.

#### Managing Play Store metadata

Gradle Play Publisher (GPP) can do anything from building, uploading, and then promoting your App Bundle or APK to publishing app listings and other
metadata. Have a look at the folder `app/src/main/play` and the
official [GPP documentation](https://github.com/Triple-T/gradle-play-publisher#managing-play-store-metadata)
to learn more about managing Play Store metadata.

#### Publishing

Once everything is properly configured, you can run the [release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml) workflow to create a new release and upload the
bundle to the Play Store.

### Enabling Firebase Crashlytics

The first step is to [register your new app with Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup?hl=en) (don't forget to add [both release and
debug packages](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2016/08/organizing-your-firebase-enabled-android-app-builds.html) to the same Firebase project).
After that, you should put the `google-services.json`, containing both release and debug applications, inside the `app/` directory.
Now you have to [Enable Crashlytics in the Firebase console](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/get-started?hl=en&platform=android#enable-in-console)
and, finally, open the Debug menu and trigger a crash using the Force Crash button.

### Encrypting your secrets

Once you have these 3 files in the following paths:

- `release/app-release.jks`
- `release/play-account.json`
- `app/google-services.json`

you can use the `release/encrypt-secrets.sh` to safely encrypt them (it's recommended to use a very strong passphrase).
