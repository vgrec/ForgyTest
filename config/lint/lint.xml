    <!-- Disable the check for `list.forEach {}` in Kotlin files  -->
    <!-- Android's lint gets confused and thinks that Kotlin is using Java's forEach (minSdk 24) -->
    <!-- This can be safely removed when we define Android minSdk to 24 -->
    <!-- We can also check this once Kotlin 1.5.0 is officially released together with the new AS 4.2+ -->
